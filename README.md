# SimWork - The Future of Work Simulation Platform

SimWork is an AI-driven, immersive "future of work" game that combines real-world tasks with adaptive difficulty, OCR-enabled asset submission, and real-time analytics. It addresses critical gaps in corporate and educational training by delivering engaging, cost-effective, and data-rich experiences that reduce mis-hires and accelerate workforce readiness.

## 🎯 Core Value Proposition

**Problem**: Companies waste money on wrong hires, fake skills pass interviews, slow hiring processes, and no real proof of skill.

**Solution**: Immersive 3D office simulation where candidates complete authentic tasks (terminal/VSCode challenges, form-filling, design briefs) with real-time KPI tracking and AI-powered adaptivity.

## 🚀 MVP Features

- **2.5D Interactive Office Map**: Navigate between Developer Bay, Design Lab, Data Entry Station
- **Real-World Task Simulation**: Embedded terminals, design tools, form interfaces
- **AI-Powered Quest Engine**: Procedurally generated challenges with adaptive difficulty
- **Real-Time Analytics**: KPI tracking, session recordings, performance dashboards
- **Multi-Role Support**: Developer, Designer, PM, Data Entry, AI Engineer roles

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.2+, React, Tailwind CSS
- **3D Engine**: Three.js for immersive office environment
- **Game Engine**: Phaser 3 for 2D game mechanics
- **Animation**: GSAP, Framer Motion
- **Effects**: Glassmorphism, Aurora lights, Particle systems
- **Data**: JSON, localStorage for MVP simulation

## 📱 Key Requirements

- **Mobile Responsive**: Perfect scaling on all devices
- **Real Working Demo**: No dummy content, professional quality
- **Future AI Design**: Next-generation UI/UX aesthetics
- **Text Contrast**: Absolute readability priority
- **Local Assets**: All external resources downloaded locally
